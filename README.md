## Pinochle
Pinochle is a turn-based card game where players compete by collecting points by throwing cards of a higher rank and suit against their opponents. 
Winners of a turn can also create Melds for extra points. Melds represent a combination of cards of particular ranks and suits.

## Pinochle in Prolog
This is a text-based implementation of Pinochle. The program also implements an AI that makes informed calculations on what card to throw next. The player can 
likewise obtain hints (along with reasonings) from the AI as to what card to play or what meld to create.
